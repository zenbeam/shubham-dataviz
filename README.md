# Shubham Srivastava - Portfolio

Welcome to my data visualization portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University.

## About Me

Hi! I'm Shubham (he/him), a graduate student in the Master of Information Systems Management program at Carnegie Mellon's Heinz College. Before coming to CMU, I spent several years in the startup world, most recently as Head of Product and Developer Relations at Zenduty, a B2B SaaS platform serving companies like Walmart, LVMH, and Razorpay. In that role, I wore many hats: founding product manager, community builder, partnership lead, and podcast host. I helped scale the company from early stage to over $2M ARR, which taught me the value of making decisions grounded in data rather than intuition alone.

I'm fascinated by the intersection of technology, entrepreneurship, and human behavior. My background spans building products, conducting hundreds of user interviews, analyzing growth metrics, and translating complex technical concepts for diverse audiences. Outside of work, I've founded a mental health platform during the pandemic, spoken at global tech conferences like KubeCon and AWS re:Invent, and hosted a podcast featuring industry veterans that reached listeners in 34 countries. I'm now exploring venture capital as a Student Partner at 99 Tartans, CMU's angel investing group, where I help evaluate early-stage startups and support founders in their journeys.

## What I Hope to Learn

I've spent years working with data in various forms: analyzing user behavior in Mixpanel, tracking conversion funnels, building dashboards, and making product decisions based on analytics. However, I've often struggled to communicate insights in ways that truly resonate with non-technical stakeholders. I've seen brilliant analyses fall flat because the visualization was confusing or the narrative wasn't compelling enough.

Through this course, I want to develop a stronger foundation in visual storytelling. I'm particularly interested in learning how to craft narratives that drive action, how to choose the right visualization for different audiences, and how to critique and improve existing data presentations. As I transition into venture capital, I expect to work with founders who need to present their metrics convincingly to investors, and I want to be able to guide them effectively.

After graduation in December, I'm pursuing roles in early-stage venture capital, focusing on B2B SaaS, developer tools, and infrastructure startups. The ability to tell compelling stories with data will be essential in that work, whether I'm evaluating a startup's growth trajectory, presenting investment theses to partners, or helping portfolio companies refine their board decks.
